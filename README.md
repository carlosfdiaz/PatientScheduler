# PatientScheduler

Patient Scheduler is a web application to manage patient records and schedule appointments with a doctor. It is a proof of concept application.


It is built using .Net Core MVC.</br>
For the calendar functionality on the frontend, I used FullCalendarIO. A JavaScript library.
https://fullcalendar.io/

The target audience is front desk staff at a doctor's office. The application allows you to create, edit, delete patient information as well as create and delete appointments for patients.

The application has one account:
* username: reception@pscheduler.com
* password: Letmein123!

I did not add a register or admin portal because I wanted to limit the scope of the application as much as possible. The database gets seeded with two doctors to choose from as well as the account mentioned above.


Below are some screenshots of the web application
